            <h2>Lyrics</h2>
            <p>Turn it up<br>
                Somebody save your soul cause you've been sinning in this city I know<br>
                Too many troubles, all these lovers got you losing control<br>
                You're like a drug to me, a luxury, my sugar and gold<br>
                I want the good life, every good night you're a hard one to hold<br>
                Cause you don't even know<br>
                I can make your hands clap<br>
                Said I can make your hands clap<br>
                Somebody save your soul cause you've been sinning in this city I know<br>
                Too many troubles, all these lovers got you losing control<br>
                You're like a drug to me, a luxury, my sugar and gold<br>
                I want your sex and your affection when they're holdin' you close<br>
                Cause you don't even know<br>
                I can make your hands clap<br>
                Said I can make your hands clap<br>
                Every night when the stars come out<br>
                Am I the only living soul around?<br>
                Need to believe you could hold me down<br>
                Cause I'm in need of somethin' good right now<br>
                We could be screamin' till the sun comes out<br>
                And when we wake we'd be the only sound<br>
                I get on my knees and say a prayer, James brown<br>
                That I can make your hands clap<br>
                That I can make your hands clap<br>
                Turn it up<br>
                That I can make your hands clap<br>
                My flesh is searchin' for your worst and best, don't ever deny<br>
                I'm like a stranger, gimme me danger<br>
                All your wrongs and your rights<br>
                Secrets on broadway to the freeway, you're a keeper of crimes<br>
                Fear no conviction, grapes of wrath can only sweeten your wine<br>
                But you don't even know<br>
                I can make your hands clap<br>
                Said I can make your hands clap<br>
                Every night when the stars come out<br>
                Am I the only living soul around?<br>
                Need to believe you could hold me down<br>
                Cause I'm in need of somethin' good right now<br>
                We could be screamin' till the sun comes out<br>
                And when we wake we'd be the only sound<br>
                I get on my knees and say a prayer: James brown<br>
                That I can make your hands clap<br>
                That I can make your hands clap<br>
                That I can make your hands clap<br>
                That I can make your hands clap<br>
                So can I get a hand clap?</p>
